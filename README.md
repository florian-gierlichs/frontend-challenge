# coding challenge

Here are some challenges that you can tackle together with your interview partners. It is not about solving all of them or solve them in a perfect manner, but more about seeing how you would approach the different tasks. Feel free to ask for help.

## 1. Fetch API

- Please extend this application by fetching and displaying some products from the api above.

  - There is no requirement on how to do this, it's up to you
  - Material UI and styled-components is already installed and ready to use

- Please implement a functionality to add a new product.

## 2. Fix and render component PTTabs

- Please have a look at `src/components/tabs/PTTabs.tsx` and render it in the App.

  - You may run into some problems rendering it correctly...
  - The component is supposed to have a working tab switch to show different content

## 3. Evaluate code snippet (not ready yet)

- Please take a look at ./.../abc and share your thoughts about the code.

## 4. Unit test

- Please build a simple component with some user interaction and write a unit test for it.

  - jest and testing-library/react is already installed and ready to use

## 5. Discuss how to improve the app

- Imagine this would be a real application in production. How would you improve the project?

# Happy Coding :heart: :rocket:
